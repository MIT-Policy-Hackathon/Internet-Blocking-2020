Consider the country pages and [search masks](https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2020-10-12) on the Ooni Explorer Website. For example, Ooni has much data collected on [Iran](https://explorer.ooni.org/country/IR). Your goal is to propose new visualizations using the same underlying Ooni data, which is particularly suited for cyber policymakers and cybersecurity experts. In Office Hours, you will have the opportunity to ask the latter group of cybersecurity experts questions on their needs.

We provided you a dataset for three countries, India, Indonesia and Iran, of all Ooni reports from the first week of March. The data preparation/scraping of this open-source dataset has been done using the [Data Preparation Script](data_preparation.py). Minimal starter code can can be found the [Starter Code file](starter_code.py). In the directories behind the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v5pbR47-6302NTpAp94lxHU-FqiAn54P?usp=sharing), each file is one report, where the filename is informative about the type and timestamp of the measurement. Compare [the description of Ooni](https://ooni.org/post/mining-ooni-data).
